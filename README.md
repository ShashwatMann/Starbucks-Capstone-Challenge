# Starbucks-Capstone-Challenge
Final Project on Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program
This project was created to better understand how people make decisions on their purchases with different offers.
There were three types of offers; Buy-One-Get-One, Discount and Informational.
I explored the three different datasets given to me and tried to understand which group of people got what kind of offer and whether they used it or not.
