# Starbucks-Capstone-Challenge
Final Project on Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program

## 1. Overview
This project gave us the dataset about Starbucks customers who use their app. The App sends out offers to them and purpose of the project was to analyze and predict whether a person would use the Offer or not. 
This project was created to better understand how people make decisions on their purchases with different offers.
There were three types of offers; Buy-One-Get-One, Discount and Informational.

## 2. The Files
### 1. portfolio.json
containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)

### 2. profile.json
demographic data for each customer

### 3. transcript.json
records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

## 3. My Work
All of the work on all three datasets were done on Jupyter Notebook. To study what I did with them, you may refer to the Medium post linked given below.
